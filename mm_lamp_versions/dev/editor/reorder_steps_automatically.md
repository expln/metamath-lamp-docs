# Reorder steps automatically

Sometimes you may find yourself in a situation where the steps are arranged in the wrong order.
For example, step 2 depends on step 1, but step 1 is located after step 2.
This usually happens after [merging similar steps](merge_similar_steps.md).

You can automatically rearrange steps with the "Reorder steps" feature. 
You can launch it from the "hamburger" menu in the editor.
It will try to rearrange steps in such a way, 
that each step appears in the editor after all other steps it depends on.
