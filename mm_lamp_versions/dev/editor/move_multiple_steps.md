# Move steps to the top or bottom

There is a feature which allows to move multiple steps to the top or bottom of the Editor.
It was implemented as a partial workaround for the problem when it is not possible to rearrange steps manually 
in the "show only bookmarked steps" mode (see the docs for [bookmarked steps](bookmark_steps.md)).

1. Select steps you want to move.
2. Select "Move steps" in the "hamburger" menu of the Editor.
3. In the opened dialog, select the new location for the selected steps.
