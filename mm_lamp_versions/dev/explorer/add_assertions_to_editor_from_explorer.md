# Add assertions to the Editor tab from the Explorer tab

Each assertion on the Explorer tab has a small button "use" which you can click to
add that assertion to the editor. 

If no step in the editor was selected before clicking "use",
then the assertion will be added on the top of all provable steps in the editor.
If a step was selected in the editor before clicking "use", 
then the assertion will be added right above the selected step.

This functionality is similar to the "Magnifying glass" button in the Editor command icon bar, 
but adding assertions from the Explorer tab may be more convenient in some cases.
