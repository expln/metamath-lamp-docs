# Inline proof

The "Inline proof" feature allows you to replace a single step with multiple steps from the proof of the
theorem used by that single step. The overall proof in the Editor will stay valid
(if it was valid before inlining).

To inline the proof of a theorem:
1. Select the step with the theorem you want to inline.
2. Select the "Inline proof" in the "hamburger" menu in the Editor.

This will inline only a single occurrence of the theorem used by the selected step.
If the same theorem is used by other steps, you have to do inlining for each of those steps, 
if you want to completely get rid of the theorem in your proof.
